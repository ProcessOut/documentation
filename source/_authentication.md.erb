# Authentication

```shell
# cURL makes it easy to authenticate
curl <%= api_link('/') %> \
  --user "<project-id>:<project-secret>"
```

```php
<?php
// Load dependencies
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Instanciate ProcessOut
$processout = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut(
    '<project-id>',
    '<project-secret>');
?>
```

```python
# Load dependencies
from processout.processout import ProcessOut

# Instanciate ProcessOut
processout = ProcessOut(
    '<project-id>',
    '<project-secret>')
```

> Make sure to replace `<project-id>` and `<project-secret>` with your details.

To use ProcessOut's API, you will need to authenticate yourself using your API keys.
Your API keys are composed of your `project-id` and `project-secret`. To get
these keys, you will need to have created a new project on your dashboard,
and browse that project's settings.

This authentication should be done during every request you make, and using the
Authorization HTTP header:

`Authorization: <authorization-code>`

<aside class="notice">
&lt;authorization-code> must be a base64 encoded string containing:

"&lt;project-id>:&lt;project-secret>"
</aside>
