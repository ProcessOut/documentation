# Get started

## Installation

```javascript
npm install processout
```

```php
composer require processout/processout-php
```

```python
pip install processout
```

```go
go get https://github.com/processout/processout-go
```

Installing and setting up the libraries/modules/packages in your project
is most of the time really easy, and only consists of running a couple of
commands and/or dropping in some files.

You may also want to simply run a `git clone` command or download an archive
containg the library, and manage the dependencies yourself.

## Authentication

```php
<?php
// Load dependencies
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate ProcessOut
$processout = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut(
    '<project-id>',
    '<project-key>');

// Set this project as the default one for the current request
\ProcessOut\ProcessOut::setDefault($processout);
?>
```

```python
# Load dependencies
from processout.processout import ProcessOut

# Instantiate ProcessOut
processout = ProcessOut(
    '<project-id>',
    '<project-key>')

# Set this project as the default one for the current request
ProcessOut.setDefault(processout)
```

```javascript
// Load package
var ProcessOut = require('processout');

// Instantiate ProcessOut
var processout = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut(
    '<project-id>',
    '<project-key>');

// Set this project as the default one for the current request
ProcessOut.ProcessOut.setDefault(processout);
```

> Make sure to replace `<project-id>` and `<project-key>` with your details.

To use ProcessOut's API, you will need to authenticate yourself using your API keys.
Your API keys are composed of your `project-id` and `project-key`. To get
these keys, you will need to have created a new project on your dashboard.

Once the authentication is done, a `ProcessOut` object should be returned,
representing your ProcessOut project.
