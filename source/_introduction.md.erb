# Introduction

> Code samples of these libraries will be shown on this pane. Feel free to choose
> your preferred language for samples by selecting it in the top bar of this pane.

Welcome to the [ProcessOut](https://www.processout.com) documentation.
The code provided here will mostly be basedon libraries using our API endpoints.
[More about it can be found here.](#api-reference)

Language bindings and examples for different libraries can be found on the right
side of the page. You can switch to your preferred language using the menu at
the top of the right side pane.

## Libraries, modules and tools

At ProcessOut, open-sourcing our projects takes a big part of our time and energy.
This is why we are giving access to several tools, libraries and projects we
use ourselves on a daily basis on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/ProcessOut/).

## API Reference

This documentation will mostly be focused on how to use our official libraries
and API bindings. If you wish to discover our full API, we have an Apiary
documentation which also provides a great mock server. This can be useful
if you would like to make your own contribution to our libraries.

[You may find our Apiary API documentation here.](http://docs.processout.apiary.io)

## Help and support

We'd be glad to help you with any problem you may have during the integration
of ProcessOut in your application. [Feel free to contact us!](https://www.processout.com/contact)
