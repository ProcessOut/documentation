# Recurring payments

## Overview

Recurring invoices are a great way to get recurring income from your customers,
with a high conversion rate. Because of how payment gateways differently handle
this type of payment, ProcessOut will try to make most of the features offered
by them.

If recurring payments are not available for the payment gateway chosen
by the customer, ProcessOut will handle the iterations of each payment by
generating new invoices for every new period, and by sending reminder emails,
but will keep it transparent for you.

## Usage

```javascript
// Create a new recurring invoice
var recurringInvoice      = new ProcessOut.RecurringInvoice();
recurringInvoice.setName('Amazing item');
recurringInvoice.setPrice(4.99);
recurringInvoice.setCurrency('USD');
// Set the recurring period to a month
recurringInvoice.setRecurringDays(30);
// You may set any field listed in table on the right pane

// Push it to ProcessOut
recurringInvoice.create()

// Print the id of the recurring invoice to be used with the modal
console.log(recurringInvoice.getId())
// > 64db379a-301f-4db6-859e-a0b342ff0b66
// or its checkout url
console.log(recurringInvoice.getUrl())
// > https://checkout.processout.com/64db379a-301f-4db6-859e-a0b342ff0b66
```

```python
from processout.recurringinvoice import RecurringInvoice

# Create a new recurring invoice object
recurringInvoice          = RecurringInvoice()
recurringInvoice.name     = 'Amazing item'
recurringInvoice.price    = 4.99
recurringInvoice.currency = 'USD'
# Set the recurring period to a month
recurringInvoice.recurringDays = 30
# You may set any field listed in table on the right pane

# Push it to ProcessOut
recurringInvoice.create()

# Print the id of the recurring invoice to be used with the modal
print(recurringInvoice.id)
# or its checkout url
# > 64db379a-301f-4db6-859e-a0b342ff0b66
print(recurringInvoice.url)
# > https://checkout.processout.com/64db379a-301f-4db6-859e-a0b342ff0b66
```

```php
<?php
// Create a new recurring invoice
$recurringInvoice = new \ProcessOut\RecurringInvoice();
$recurringInvoice
    ->setName('Amazing item')
    ->setPrice(4.99)
    ->setCurrency('USD')
    // Set the recurring period to a month
    ->setRecurringDays(30);
// You may set any field listed in table on the right pane

// Push it to ProcessOut
$recurringInvoice->create();

// Print the id of the recurring invoice to be used with the modal
echo $recurringInvoice->getId();
// > 64db379a-301f-4db6-859e-a0b342ff0b66
// or its checkout url
echo $recurringInvoice->getUrl();
// > https://checkout.processout.com/64db379a-301f-4db6-859e-a0b342ff0b66
?>
```

Making a recurring invoice takes one line of code with ProcessOut,
if you're already using our [invoicing solution](#invoices).

The field `recurring_days` must be set to the `number of days` you wish your
invoicing period to last (defaults to 0), and the field `request_email` will
automatically be set to `true`. Otherwise, the same fields used
when creating a normal invoice may be used.
