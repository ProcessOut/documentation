# Sandbox

```php
<?php
$projectId     = '<project-id>';
$projectSecret = '<project-key>';

// To enable the sandbox
if($sandbox)
    $projectId = 'sandbox-' . $projectId;

$processout = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut(
    $projectId, $projectSecret);
?>
```

```csharp
/* In order to work with the sandbox,
 * simply prepend "sandbox-" to your
 * project key
 */
 
 var MyProcessOut = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut(
        "<project-id>",
        "sandbox-<project-key>");
```

```python
projectId     = '<project-id>'
projectSecret = '<project-key>'

# To enable the sandbox
if sandbox:
    projectId = 'sandbox-' + projectId

processout = ProcessOut(
    projectId, projectSecret)
```

```javascript
var projectId     = '<project-id>';
var projectSecret = '<project-key>';

// To enable the sandbox
if(sandbox) {
    projectId = 'sandbox-' + projectId
}

var processout = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut(
    projectId, projectSecret)
```

> When deploying to production, you should verify that your webhooks are
> not coming from the sandbox

```php
<?php
// Let's assume $data is filled with the webhook json decoded data

// Verify that the webhook is NOT from the sandbox
if($data['sandbox'] && !$sandbox)
{
    echo 'Sandbox mode is not allowed.';
    exit();
}
?>
```

```python
# Let's assume data is filled with the webhook json decoded data

# Verify that the webhook is NOT from the sandbox
if data['sandbox'] and not sandbox:
    print ('Sandbox mode is not allowed.')
    return
```

```javascript
// Let's assume data is filled with the webhook json decoded data

// Verify that the webhook is NOT from the sandbox
if(data['sandbox'] && !sandbox) {
    console.log('Sandbox mode is not allowed.');
    return;
}
```

When developing your application, you might need to troubleshoot
problems which may occur when implementing ProcessOut.

We created a simple-to-use sandbox which lets you send all kinds of
webhooks to your application. To enable the sandbox, all you need to do
is to prepend `sandbox-` to your project id.
The checkout page of invoices you create under the sandbox
will display a list of states that you can trigger. These states,
when triggered, will send a webhook to your application.

<aside class="notice">
When deploying to production, make sure to remove <code>sandbox-</code> and to check that
the webhooks you receive are <strong>NOT</strong> coming from the sandbox.
