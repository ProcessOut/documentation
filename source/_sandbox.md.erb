# Sandbox

```php
<?php
$projectId     = '<project-id>';
$projectSecret = '<project-secret>';

// If we want to enable sandbox
if($sandbox)
    $projectId = 'sandbox-' . $projectId;

$processout = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut(
    $projectId, $projectSecret);
?>
```

```python
projectId     = '<project-id>'
projectSecret = '<project-secret>'

# If we want to enable sandbox
if sandbox:
    projectId = 'sandbox-' + projectId

processout = ProcessOut(
    projectId, projectSecret)
```

> When deploying to production, you should check if your webhooks are coming from
> the sandbox

```php
<?php
// Let's assume $data is filled with the webhook json decoded data

// Check if the webhook is from the sandbox but we don't want it
if($data['sandbox'] && !$sandbox)
{
    echo 'Sandbox mode is not allowed.';
    exit();
}
?>
```

```python
# Let's assume data is filled with the webhook json decoded data

# Check if the webhook is from the sandbox but we don't want it
if data['sandbox'] and not sandbox:
    print ('Sandbox mode is not allowed.')
    return
```

When developing your application, you might need to troubleshot
problems which may occur when implementing ProcessOut.

We created a simple-to-use sandbox which lets you send all kinds of
webhooks to your application. To enable the sandbox, all you need to do
is to prepend `sandbox-` to your project id.
Every invoice created under the sandbox will show on the checkout page
the list of states you can trigger, sending a webhook to your application.

<aside class="notice">
When going into production, make sure to remove <code>sandbox-</code> and to check that
the webhooks you receive are <strong>not</strong> coming from the sandbox.
