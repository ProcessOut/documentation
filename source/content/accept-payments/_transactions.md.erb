## Payment notifications

### Transactions

Transactions are *read-only* objects linked to their corresponding [invoice](#invoices),
representing the actual payment that occured on an invoice.

ProcessOut will automatically generate and/or update Transation resources
depending on the status of the payment. This resource is also the main one
that'll be sent to you through [Events and Webhooks](#webhooks) to notify you 
of a new payment.

Any metadata specified on an invoice will also be available in th metadata of
this invoice's transaction for easy reference.

##### Attributes

by ProcessOut when the payment gateway pushes an update.
