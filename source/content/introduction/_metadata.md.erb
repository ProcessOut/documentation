## Metadata

It is possible to add context to the main ProcessOut resources (such as [invoices](#invoices),
[customers](#customers) or [subscriptions](#subscriptions)). Such context can range
from the country of the customer to some internal ID you have on your side to track
the order.

Some keywords in the metadata are reserved for specific uses:

- *taxes_amount* is zero or positive number representing the taxes included in the `amount`
- *shipping_amount* is a zero or positive number representing the shipping costs included in the `amount`
