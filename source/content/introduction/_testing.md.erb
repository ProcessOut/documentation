## Testing

```javascript
var processout = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut()
// Prefix project ID with `test-`
processout.setProjectId('test-<project-id>');
processout.setProjectSecret('<project-key>');
```

```python
processout = ProcessOut()
# Prefix project ID with `test-`
processout.projectId = 'test-<project-id>'
processout.projectSecret = '<project-key>'
```

```php
<?php
$processout = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut();
// Prefix project ID with `test-`
$processout->setProjectId('test-<project-id>');
$processout->setProjectSecret('<project-key>');
```

```go
// Prefix project ID with `test-`
projectID := "test-<project-id>"
projectSecret := "<project-key>"

p := processout.New(projectID, projectSecret)
```

When developing your application, you might need to troubleshoot
problems which may occur in your ProcessOut implementation.

The ProcessOut **testing environment** lets you interact with the ProcessOut API
without having to go through the checkout processes on the different available
gateways. This is especially useful when first implementing payments to your
online website.

Keep in mind that resources created in the testing and live environments are not
shared.
