## Cancel a subscription

Canceling a customer subscription is made very easy. By default, cancellations
are effective immediately.

### Retrieve the subscription

```javascript
// Find a recurring invoice from its id
ProcessOut.RecurringInvoice.find('<recurring-invoice-id>').then(
    function(recurringInvoice) {
    // You may now access the fetched recurringInvoice

}, function(err) {
    // An error occured

});
```

```python
from processout.recurringinvoice import RecurringInvoice

# Find a recurring invoice from its id
recurringInvoice = RecurringInvoice.find('<recurring-invoice-id>')
```

```php
<?php
// Find a recurring invoice from its id
$recurringInvoice = \ProcessOut\RecurringInvoice::find('<recurring-invoice-id>');
```

```go
// Find a recurring invoice from its ID
riv, err := p.RecurringInvoices.Find("<recurring-invoice-id>")

// Do things with riv!
```

> Replace `<recurring-invoice-id>` with the recurring invoice ID.

Find a subscription by its `id`.

If a subscription corresponding to the `id` is found, a new subscription object
is returned.

### Cancel the subscription

```javascript
recurringInvoice.end('Reason goes here').then(function(success) {
    // Successfully ended

}, function(err) {
    // Could not end it

});
```

```python
success = recurringInvoice.end('Reason goes here')
```

```php
<?php
$success = $recurringInvoice->end('Reason goes here');
```

```go
err = p.RecurringInvoices.End(riv, "Reason goes here")
```

Once the recurring invoice is retrieved, you can end it and provide a `reason`
for the cancellation.
