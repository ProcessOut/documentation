#### Configure the gateways you want to use

ProcessOut is at its core a smart router for payments. We make sure every 
transaction takes the best possible path available to optimize your revenues and
minimize your costs and fraud. 

In order to provide you with the best paths, the router needs to have several
ones to work with. To get started, go into your 
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.processout.com) &rsaquo; Payment providers &rsaquo; and
add a new payment provider.

#### Store your cards on the ProcessOut third-party vault

When starting a business, storing the cards of your customers on the payment
gateway you use is easy and great. However, as your business grows you'll
need some additional flexibility so you can switch from one gateway to another
and not get locked in. 

ProcessOut offers every merchant the possibility of 
storing the cards of its customers, and can use these card in any of the 
integrated payment gateways. This effectively gives you the power of switching
from one gateway to another and have leverage on the payment processing pricing.
