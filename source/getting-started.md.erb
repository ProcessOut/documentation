platform.

#### Configure your gateways and smart route transactions

ProcessOut is at its core a smart router for payments. We make sure every 
transaction takes the best possible path available to optimize your revenues and
minimize your costs and fraud. 

In order to provide you with the best paths, the router needs to have several
ones to work with. To get started, go into your 
[Dashboard &nearr;](https://dashboard.processout.com) &rsaquo; Payment providers &rsaquo; and
add a new payment provider.

#### Store your cards on the ProcessOut third-party vault

When starting a business, storing the cards of your customers on the payment
gateway you use is easy and great. However, as your business grows you'll
need some additional flexibility so you can switch from one gateway to another
and not get locked in. 

ProcessOut offers every merchant the possibility to 
[store the cards &nearr;](/payments/save-token-and-capture-later.html) of its 
customers, and can use these card in any of the integrated payment gateways. 
This effectively gives you back the power of switching from one gateway to another 
and have leverage on the payment processing fees.

#### Accept alternative payment gateway payments

Although ProcessOut focuses on smart routing transactions made with credit
cards, we also provide merchants with an 
[easy to integrate solution &nearr;](/payments/alternative-payment-methods.html) for
alternative payment gateways. This lets merchant reach broader markets where
the card isn't always the preferred solution. Alternative gateways range from
well-known ones in the US such as [PayPal](https://paypal.com) to very local
payment schemes such as [Alipay in China](https://intl.alipay.com/).
