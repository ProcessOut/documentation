# Migrating to ProcessOut

Most of the time, if you operate a SaaS or recurring business, or even an e-commerce
that provides one-click checkouts, you have tokenized your customers cards in
your PSPs Vault.

Because ProcessOut is a PCI-DSS Service Provider Level 1 ([see our certification here &nearr;](https://www.processout.com/documents/pci-dss-aoc.pdf)), we can store card details for you in the PSP Agnostic ProcessOut Vault. We can therefore make it easy for 
you to switch over to ProcessOut by syncing with your old Payment Service Provider 
and importing the card numbers they stored on their side. This allows you to 
provide uninterrupted service to your customers as you switch over your payments 
to ProcessOut.

Please note that ProcessOut will only import Card objects from your old PSPs. 
Re-creating Customer, Plans or Subscriptions objects should be done at your own discretion.

## Step 1: Preparing your ProcessOut integration

Before getting your cards exported from your old PSP to ProcessOut, you'll need
to integrate ProcessOut into your application. This can be done following
our integration guides and testing environment.

Learn more about how to tokenize new cards with [ProcessOut.js &nearr;](/payments/processoutjs/), [create Customer
Tokens from them](/payments/save-token-and-capture-later/) and use our [Subscriptions engine &nearr;](/subscriptions/get-started/).

Once your integration of ProcessOut is validated within your application, you'll
need to start sending all new customers and cards to ProcessOut
while keeping legacy customers going through your old PSP. This is a necessary
step to ensure that when we initiate the import from your old PSP, we're sure
that no new cards will be created in your old PSP, which would de-synchronize
the import and miss cards leading to lost payments.

## Step 2: Intro your ProcessOut Account Manager to your old PSP

Now that you've launched ProcessOut in your application so that all new customers and
cards get sent and processed on ProcessOut, you can intro your ProcessOut Account
Manager to your old PSP Account Manager. We'll synchronize with them to initiate
the cards export. This is a manual step that can take from a few days to 2 weeks
depending on your old PSP.

Typically, your old PSP will send a CSV or JSON file containing all your Customers' cards
in an SFTP (a secure server used to store files), to which they'll give us access. These files
will also be sent in an encrypted fashion with the public keys we'll provide to your old
PSP so that only authorized/certified parties can access the cards.

## Step 3: Cards get imported in ProcessOut and aliased

The exported files from your old PSPs will most of the time contain the old
IDs of their associated cards. For example,
if on your old PSP had stored an ID of `12345` for the given card, we'll create 
a card on our side with the ID `card_psp-name_12345` so it's easy for you to do
the migration without requiring a map table.

## Wrap-up

With the cards now imported to ProcessOut, you can finalize the migration by
removing instances of your old PSP in your applications code and switching over
all the logic to ProcessOut. From that point on, all new and old transactions
and customers will go through ProcessOut.

Making all transactions go through ProcessOut doesn't necessarily mean you'll stop processing
transactions on your old PSP though! If you chose so, you can configure your 
ProcessOut routing rules to keep sending transactions (or only a specific portion of them,
these can be your very own rules!) to your old PSP.

We're glad to have you onboard!
