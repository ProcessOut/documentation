## Handle alternative payment methods

On top of helping you accept payments using credit cards, ProcessOut also
lets you accept payments through alternative payment methods, such as 
[PayPal](https://paypal.com) or [cryptocurrencies with coinpayments](https://coinpayments.com).

<hr>

#### Native to the payment modal

Before getting into the white-label integration, it is important to note that the
[ProcessOut modal &nearr;](#) comes with the alternative payment methods right from
the start, without any additional work needed. The modal is a perfect fit if it
fits your needs. 

#### Alternative payment methods flow

Because of their nature, most alternative payment methods are `asynchronous`. This
means that you normally wouldn't be able to synchronously tell the customer if its
payment correctly made it through until you receive a confirmation from the
payment method webhooks (such as from the *PayPal IPN*). This is mainly due
to the fact that a redirection is usually required.

ProcessOut tries to bridge that gap by letting merchants keep control of their
customer flow, **even after a redirection**. The customer is transparently
redirected to the payment method's payment page in a new window, and once the
the payment is completed, the alternative payment method's window is closed
and the original merchant payment page is notified of the payment via Javascript. 

#### Fetching the available alternative payment methods

Before showing the payment methods to the customer, they need to be fetched
from your ProcessOut configuration. This lets you dynamically enable and disable
payment options without having to update any of your code.

In order to fetch your ProcessOut gateways configuration, we'll also need to
create an invoice, as some of the gateways will need some information before
the payment actually takes place.

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```go
client := processout.New("proj_vPDoaE0dHoPtsek8SqbwTpgeTN1toazN", 
    "key-YGrDVFw4VjtAbudi5iErsMbBiHakIPpd")

// Let's create an invoice
iv, err := p.Invoices.Create(&processout.Invoice{
    Name:     "Amazing item",
    Amount:   "4.99",
    Currency: "USD",
}, processout.Options{
    Expand: []string{"project"},
})
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// And now fetch the project available gateways for one-off payments
gateways, erri := p.Projects.GatewayConfigurations(iv.Project, 
    processout.Options{
        Expand:         []string{"gateway"},
        Filter:         "tags: redirection flows: one-off",
        DisableLogging: true,
    })
```
</div>

#### Displaying alternative methods payment links

The `gateways` variable fetched in the previous steps now contains all the
available alternative payment gateways that were configured and activated
on your project. We also created a new [`Invoice` &nearr;](#) that we'll
use to redirect the customer to the payment page.

A payment link for an alternative payment gateway is as follows:

```html
<form action="/your-capture-endpoint" method="POST" id="payment-form">
  <!-- Loop through all your gateway configurations and display the link
       below.
       ProcessOut-checkout-domain/:invoice_id/redirect/:gateway_configuration_id -->
  <a href="https://checkout.processout.com/iv_tIWEiBcrXIFHzJeXcZzqyp8EpY0xwmuT/redirect/gway_conf_vMFNzz1GnWYRUJWFgUhn4HajCYmJiMsi"
    class="alternative-payment-link">

    Pay now!
  </a>
</form>
```

**Note**: The links are put in a form so that we can later post the `token`
representing the payment back to the merchant's backend.

#### Hooking ProcessOut.js on the payment links

We could technically stop there and simply redirect the customer to the checkout
pages, but the merchant would lose control over its customer checkout flow.
ProcessOut.js lets you control the redirection from your payment page so you can
cancel the payment at any time, and be notified synchronously of a new payment.

```html
<script src="https://js.processout.com/processout.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    var client = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut("proj_vPDoaE0dHoPtsek8SqbwTpgeTN1toazN");
    // Let's hook every link:
    var formElement = document.getElementById("payment-form");
    var links = formElement.querySelectorAll(".alternative-payment-link");
    for(var i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
      links[i].addEventListener("click", processoutRedirectHandler);
    }
  });
</script>
```

**Note**: Remember to replace the project ID in the example with your own. When testing,
prepend your project ID with `test-` like so: `test-proj_vPDoaE0dHoPtsek8SqbwTpgeTN1toazN`.

We also still have to add the handler, which we'll do just now:

#### Handle the redirection

When a customer will click on the alternative gateway link, the `processoutRedirectHandler`
function will be called. Let's define it:

```javascript
function processoutRedirectHandler(el, e) {
  // Prevent from doing the default redirection
  e.preventDefault();

  var action = client.handleAction(el.getAttribute("href"), 
    function(token) {
      // The payment customer completed the gateway payment flow,
      // we can send the token back to our backend to finish its
      // capture
      var field   = document.createElement("input");
      field.type  = "hidden";
      field.name  = "token";
      field.value = token;
      formElement.submit();
    }, function(err) {
      // An error occured during checkout. This could just be the
      // customer that canceled the payment, or an error with
      // the payment gateway.
      alert(err);
    });

  return false;
}
```

#### Handle the capture on the server

`ProcessOut.js` sent the `token` back to our server so we need to finish
its capture. We'll need both the `token` and the `invoice ID` we created
earlier and used to redirect the customer.

The code to capture the token returned by `ProcessOut.js` during an alternative
gateway checkout is **identical** to the capture of a card token.

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```sh
curl https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_tIWEiBcrXIFHzJeXcZzqyp8EpY0xwmuT/capture \
    -d source="gway_req_V2UncmUgaGlyaW5nIQ=="
```
</div>

**Note**: The gateway request token sent by `ProcessOut.js` is actually only
an abstraction of the request done by the customer on the gateway. The content
of the token is therefore directly encoded inside it, in base64.

The capture should return a transaction if it was successful. It is strongly
advised to check its `captured` attribute to make sure the payment made it fully
through.
