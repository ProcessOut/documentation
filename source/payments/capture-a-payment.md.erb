## Capturing a payment and getting paid

Previous to capturing a payment, you must first have generated or stored a token
using [`ProcessOut.js` &nearr;](/payments/processout.js.html) and send it back to the server. This guide
aims at making use of this token to capture a payment.

#### Generating an invoice

Prior to getting paid, you first need to create an [`Invoice` &nearr;](/refs/index.html#invoices) resource
meant to define how much your customer will get charged, and set metadata
related to the payment.

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/invoices \
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd \
    -d name="Awesome invoice" \
    -d amount="9.99" \
    -d currency=USD 
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newInvoice({
    name:     "Amazing item",
    amount:   "4.99",
    currency: "USD"
}).create().then(function(invoice) {
    // invoice is our newly created resource

}, function(err) {
    // An error occured

});
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
invoice = client.new_invoice({
    "name":     "Amazing item",
    "amount":   "4.99",
    "currency": "USD"
}).create()
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
invoice = client.invoice.new(
    name:     "Amazing item",
    amount:   "4.99",
    currency: "USD"
).create
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$invoice = $client->newInvoice(array(
    "name"     => "Amazing item",
    "amount"   => "4.99",
    "currency" => "USD"
))->create();
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
iv, err := client.NewInvoice(&processout.Invoice{
    Name:     "Amazing item",
    Amount:   "4.99",
    Currency: "USD",
}).Create()
```
</div>


#### Capturing the invoice

Now that we have an invoice, we can capture it using the token previously
generated by [`ProcessOut.js` &nearr;](/payments/processout.js).

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_lEZFFcQg5WwpKcolBrlzioeeFnnuPmyE/capture \
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd \
    -d source=card_Tpu6ZOCDu1tnDKp0kTnPOcVDMUbW7dTU
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
invoice.capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ").then(
    function(transaction) {
        // 

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be captured
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
transaction = invoice.capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
transaction = invoice.capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$transaction = $invoice->capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
tr, _ := iv.Capture("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```
</div>

If the capture was successful, a transaction is returned. You may then check that
its `status` attribute is set to `completed` in order to confirm the payment.
Learn more about the transaction's statuses [here &nearr;](/payments/handle-status-changes-webhooks.html#transaction-statuses).


#### Authorizing to only capture later

It is also possible to only authorize a payment and capture it later (7 days
max). This is done using the authorization & capture flow. Let's first
authorize the payment:

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_lEZFFcQg5WwpKcolBrlzioeeFnnuPmyE/authorize \
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd \
    -d source=card_Tpu6ZOCDu1tnDKp0kTnPOcVDMUbW7dTU
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
invoice.authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ").then(
    function(transaction) {
        //

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be authorized
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
transaction = invoice.authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
transaction = invoice.authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$transaction = $invoice->authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
tr, _ := iv.Authorize("card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ")
```
</div>

If the authorization was successful, a transaction is returned. You may also
check its `status` field is set to `authorized` to confirm the authorization.
Now that the payment was authorized, you can save the ID of the `Invoice` you
generated earlier, and capture it a later time (the token isn't needed when
an authorization has already been done):

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_lEZFFcQg5WwpKcolBrlzioeeFnnuPmyE/capture
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd \
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
invoice.capture("").then(
    function(transaction) {
        // 

    }, function(err) {
        // The invoice could not be captured
    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
transaction = invoice.capture("")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
transaction = invoice.capture("")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$transaction = $invoice->capture("");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
tr, _ := iv.Capture("")
```
</div>

If the capture was successful, the same transaction as the one returned when doing
the authorization should be returned. You may check that its `status` attribute
is now set to `completed` to confirm the payment.
