# Dashboard permissions

The ProcessOut dashboard allows you to give your collaborators access to your 
global payments data, including the analytics, transactions, customers, finance
or development tools.

## Adding a collaborator to your project

Adding a collaborator to your ProcessOut project is very easy: if you're
an Owner of the project, simply [go to your ProcessOut dashboard &nearr;](https://dashboard.processout.com),
and in the left-side menu click on `Settings`. In the `Team` sub-menu, click
on the `Add collaborator` button and enter your collaborator's email, and save.

An email will be sent to the address provided with onboarding directions. Your 
collaborator will then be able to access your Project's dashboard and see the
data you've given it access to.

## Handling permissions for your collaborators

Collaborators can have two types of permissions:

- `owner`, which basically grants all rights to the user, similarly to the primary owner of the project;
- or use Permission groups.

In the same `Settings > Team` section on your ProcessOut dashboard, you can
configure Permission groups. Each group can be configured to grant specific
permissions to the Collaborators part of these groups:

- `Customers` grants access to all data related to your Customers, including personal data, Cards used and Transactions processed per Customer;
- `Developer tools` grants access to API credentials used to interact with ProcessOut, as well as other programming tools such as Events and Webhooks setup;
- `Finance reports` grants access to Payouts, Uploads and Exports;
- `Monitoring` grants access to Telescope and the Analytics/Monitoring tools;
- `Payment settings` grants access to your configured Payment Service Providers as well as your Routing Rules;
- `Subscriptions` grants access to your Customers Subscriptions handled on ProcessOut;
- `Transactions` grants access to Transactions processed on ProcessOut as well as their related information, such as their related Card or Customer.

Each Permission can also be set up in either `Read` or `Write` access. `Read`
access only allows your Collaborators to see the data, whereas `Write` also 
allows them to create new ones, or update/delete existing ones.
