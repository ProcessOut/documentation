## Testing

```shell
# Simply prepend test- to the project ID
curl https://api.processout.com/ \
    -u test-proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd
```

```javascript
var ProcessOut = require('processout');
// Prefix project ID with `test-`
var client = new ProcessOut.ProcessOut(
    "test-proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4",
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd");
```

```python
from processout.processout import ProcessOut
# Prefix project ID with `test-`
client = ProcessOut(
    "test-proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4", 
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd")
```

```ruby
require "processout"

# Prefix project ID with `test-`
client = ProcessOut::Client.new(
    "test-proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4", 
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd")
```

```php
<?php
// Prefix project ID with `test-`
$client = new \ProcessOut\ProcessOut(
    "test-proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4",
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd");
```

```go
import "gopkg.in/processout.v3"
// Prefix project ID with `test-`
client := processout.New(
    "test-proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4", 
    "key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd")
```

It is useful to be able to go through the whole payment process without
involving any real payment while implementing ProcessOut.

The ProcessOut **testing environment** lets you interact with the ProcessOut API
without having to go through the checkout processes on the different available
gateways. This is especially useful when first implementing payments to your
online website.

The testing and production environments are kept entirely separated. Resources 
created under the test environment may not be accessed in production, and
production resources may not be used for test purposes.

##### Test cards

The checkout flow you'll experience when implementing ProcessOut will be the
exact same as you'd get in production, except no real payment will be made.

In order to properly test edge cases, we provide you with test
cards that can be used the payment modal or within ProcessOut.js when
tokenizing a card. 

Each of those cards have a different behaviour so you can
test different scenarios. Any other card will fail.

The full test cards list can be found [here &nearr;](/testing.html).
