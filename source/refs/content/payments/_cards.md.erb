## Cards

Cards resources are card objects created using [ProcessOut.js](/payments/processoutjs).
A card object is an immutable object that should only be used once. Once the card
has been used to capture a payment or create a customer token, the 
card object may not be used anymore. 

For this reason, if you wish to capture
several payments using the card (at once or in the future), you must create 
a [customer token](#tokens).

ProcessOut will also fire [events](#events) when a card is going to expire so that you 
can ask your customers to update their payment details.

### Tokenize a card

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/cards \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d name="John Smith" \
    -d number=4242424242424242 \
    -d exp_month=12 \
    -d exp_year=2020 \
    -d cvc2=200
```

```javascript
// NodeJS is currently not supported for Cards (please use ProcessOut.js instead)
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
# Python is currently not supported for Cards
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
# Ruby is currently not supported for Cards
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
// PHP is currently not supported for Cards
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
// Go is currently not supported for Cards
```

Tokenizing a card on ProcessOut can be done using the Cards endpoint. It is most
useful to merchants already PCI compliant. However, for most merchants and 
use-cases we strongly advise to use our ProcessOut.js and mobile SDKs to 
tokenize the cards, as these SDKs allow you to remove the need for complexe
card data certifications (PCI-DSS).

### Fetch a card

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.processout.com/cards/card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %>
```

```javascript
// NodeJS is currently not supported for Cards
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
# Python is currently not supported for Cards
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
# Ruby is currently not supported for Cards
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
// PHP is currently not supported for Cards
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
// Go is currently not supported for Cards
```

Retrieve a card to fetch data stored earlier during a tokenization call.

This API endpoint can also be used to **detokenize** a card if you own a PCI
environment. Please talk to your ProcessOut account manager to learn more!
