## Refunds

Once a payment is placed, the merchant has the ability to refund a part or the 
entire transaction amount. This is especially useful when doing customer
support, as refunds are generally free compared to chargebacks. It is strongly
advised to issue a refund (full or partial) when you think a transaction is
fraudulent.

### Issue a refund

```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/transactions/tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC/refunds \
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd \
    -d reason=customer_request
    -d amount=4.99
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newRefund({
    reason: "customer_request",
    amount: "4.99"
}).apply("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC").then(
    function(refund) {
        // 

    }, function(err) {
        // An error occured

    });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
refund = client.new_refund({
    "reason": "customer_request",
    "amount": "4.99"
}).apply("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
refund = client.refund.new(
    reason: "customer_request",
    amount: "4.99"
).apply("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$refund = $client->newRefund(array(
    "reason" => "customer_request",
    "amount" => "4.99"
))->apply("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
refund, err := client.NewRefund({
    Reason: "customer_request",
    Amount: "4.99"
}).Apply("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC")
```

Refunding a transaction can be done by providing the transaction ID to be
refunded, as well as the amount and a reason for the refund, which can be
either `customer_request`, `duplicate` or `fraud`.

The amount can also be left empty to operate a full refund on the transaction.
In case partial refunds were previously applied on the transaction, leaving
the refund amount empty will refund what's left of the transaction amount.

### Fetch a refund

```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/transactions/tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC/refunds/refd_QKliea9OGXtLBXcar2SJjfD11aY0J2SH \
    -u proj_OvJdvN73Ds1pecfQez2J13pK1YlRqFh4:key-qiOniTQlt8OazoMrnYJKaSnBhRpWN5Rd
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newRefund().find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC", 
    "refd_QKliea9OGXtLBXcar2SJjfD11aY0J2SH").then(
        function(refund) {
            // Refund was fetched
        }, function(err) {
            // An error occured
        });
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
refund = client.new_refund().find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC",
    "refd_QKliea9OGXtLBXcar2SJjfD11aY0J2SH")
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
refund = client.refund.find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC",
    "refd_QKliea9OGXtLBXcar2SJjfD11aY0J2SH")
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$refund = $client->newRefund()->find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC",
    "refd_QKliea9OGXtLBXcar2SJjfD11aY0J2SH");
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
refund, err := client.NewRefund().Find("tr_ItJdKlhfaVn0SUGd9z1i9Jqe0STl4jxC",
    "refd_QKliea9OGXtLBXcar2SJjfD11aY0J2SH")
```

It is possible to fetch a transaction's refund by its ID. An error is thrown 
if the refund could not be found for the specified transaction.
