## 3D-Secure

3D-Secure is a protocol developed by card schemes (such as Visa or Mastercard) to
provide a way to better authenticate the buyer through its bank and improve the 
security of online payments.
Its goal is to reduce fraud and improve the ratio of approved transactions.

Please note that not every card scheme is compatible with the 3D-Secure protocole,
and even though a card could be compatible, it might not be enrolled in the 
3D-Secure program.

### Initiate a 3D-Secure flow

```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/invoices/iv_MgeLS2Rr3ZGwjqOvDvYSuWx7ce88luXl/three-d-s \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d source=card_1jSEVrx7oaRta1KEdxoMWbiGkK2MijrZ
```

To initiate a 3D-Secure flow, you'll first need to have a pending [invoice](#create-an-invoice)
ready. You'll also need to either have a [card](#cards) or a [customer token](#tokens)
representing a card to initiate the 3DS authentication.

If the provided card is enrolled in a 3D-Secure program, a `customer_action` 
will be returned, of a type `url` and a `value`` containing the link to which
your customer should be redirected to. 

Once redirected to the customer action URL, the customer will be able to
authenticate on its bank. When the authentication is done, it is then
redirected back to ProcessOut to verify the 3DS authentication. If you
specified a `return_url` during the [invoice](#invoices) creation, the customer
will also be redirected back to this link so you can continue with the payment
flow.

### Capture a 3DS invoice

When a transaction is fully 3D-Secure authenticated, you can follow the same
flow as usual, by calling either `authorize` or `capture` on the invoice to
[finish the payment](#capture-an-invoice).

*Keep in mind* that when authorizing/capturing a previously 3D-Secure authenticated
transaction you should use the same card that was used to initiate the 3D-Secure
flow.
