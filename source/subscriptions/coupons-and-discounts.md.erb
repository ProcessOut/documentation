# Offer discounts to your customers

Offering coupons and discounts for your customers' subscriptions is a great way to
acquire new users by lowering the friction.

## What are coupons and discounts

A [`Coupon` &nearr;](/refs/#coupons) can be seen
as a template for a [`Discount` &nearr;](/refs/#discounts) to be applied on a subscription: the coupon
can be a percentage of the subscription's price, or a fixed amount. A customer
can also have multiple coupons applied on one of its subscriptions.

A coupon is also composed of several additional attributes that can be used to 
further control how your coupons are used:

- `iteration_count` is the number of iteration of the subscription the coupon will last.
For example, a coupon with an `iteration_count` of 3 applied on a monthly subscription
will last 3 months. If this attribute is set to `0`, the applied discount will
last forever.
- `max_redemptions` is the maximum number of times a coupon can be redeemed 
(ie applied on a subscription) by your customers before expiring.
- `expires_at` is the date at which the coupon will automatically expire.

It is also important to note that coupons cannot be redeemed more than once
per subscription, and the amount deduced by the sum of all the discounts
applied to a subscription cannot be greater than the amount of the subscription.

## Create a coupon

The easiest way to apply discounts on your customers' subscriptions it to
create coupon codes that can be redeemed by your customers (or yourself in
your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.processout.com)).

For reference, let's create one through the API:

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/coupons \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d id="25percentoff" \
    -d percent_off=25 \
    -d iteration_count=3 \
    -d expires_at="2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newCoupon().create({
    id:              "25percentoff",
    percent_off:     25,
    iteration_count: 3,
    expires_at:      "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
}).then(function(coupon) {
    // 

}, function(err) {
    // The coupon could not be created. Maybe a coupon with this
    // ID already exists?
});
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
coupon = client.new_coupon().create({
    "id":              "25percentoff",
    "percent_off":     25,
    "iteration_count": 3,
    "expires_at":      "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
})
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
coupon = client.coupon.create(
    id:              "25percentoff",
    percent_off:     25,
    iteration_count: 3,
    expires_at:      "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
)
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$coupon = $client->newCoupon()->create(array(
    "id":              "25percentoff",
    "percent_off":     25,
    "iteration_count": 3,
    "expires_at":      "2022-10-02T15:00:00Z"
));
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
coupon, err := client.NewCoupon().Create(&processout.CouponCreateParameters{
    Coupon: &processout.Coupon{
        ID:             processout.String("25percentoff"),
        PercentOff:     processout.Int64(25),
        IterationCount: processout.Int64(3),
        ExpiresAt:      processout.Time(time.Now()),
    },
})
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
</div>

## Apply a coupon to a subscription

Now that we've created a coupon, let's create and apply a subscription for a
customer of ours (you'll need to replace the ID of the customer with one
of yours):

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/subscriptions \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d customer_id=cust_uYW5WVnjHe91qnsUA1sHOxEjdAySvg0P \
    -d plan_id="silver-plan" \
    -d coupon_id="25percentoff"

# or 
curl -X POST https://api.processout.com/subscriptions/sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3/discounts \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %> \
    -d coupon_id=25percentoff
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newSubscription().create({
    customer_id: "cust_uYW5WVnjHe91qnsUA1sHOxEjdAySvg0P",
    plan_id:     "silver-plan",
    coupon_id:   "25percentoff"
}).then(function(subscription) {
    // The discount is now applied to the subscription!

}, function(err) {
    // An error occured

});

client.newDiscount().create({
    subscription_id: "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3",
    coupon_id:       "25percentoff"
});

// or
subscription.applyCoupon("25percentoff");
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
subscription = client.new_subscription().create({
    "customer_id": "cust_uYW5WVnjHe91qnsUA1sHOxEjdAySvg0P",
    "plan_id":     "silver-plan",
    "coupon_id":   "25percentoff"
})

# or
discount = client.new_discount().create({
    "subscription_id": "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3",
    "coupon_id":       "25percentoff"
})
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
subscription = client.subscription.create(
    customer_id: "cust_uYW5WVnjHe91qnsUA1sHOxEjdAySvg0P",
    plan_id:     "silver-plan",
    coupon_id:   "25percentoff"
)

# or
discount = client.discount.create(
    subscription_id: "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3",
    coupon_id:       "25percentoff"
)
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$subscription = $client->newSubscription()->create(array(
    "customer_id" => "cust_uYW5WVnjHe91qnsUA1sHOxEjdAySvg0P",
    "plan_id"     => "silver-plan",
    "coupon_id"   => "25percentoff"
));

// or
$discount = $client->newDiscount()->create(array(
    "subscription_id" => "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3",
    "coupon_id"       => "25percentoff"
));
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
sub, _ := client.NewSubscription().Create(&processout.SubscriptionCreateParameters{
    Subscription: &processout.Subscription{
        CustomerID: processout.String("cust_uYW5WVnjHe91qnsUA1sHOxEjdAySvg0P"),
        PlanID:     processout.String("silver-plan"),
    },
    CouponID: "25percentoff",
})

// or
discount, err := client.NewDiscount().Create(&processout.DiscountCreateParameters{
    Discount: &processout.Discount{
        SubscriptionID: processout.String("sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3"),
        CouponID:       processout.String("25percentoff"),
    }})
```
</div>

## Remove a coupon discount

Sometimes, you might also want to remove a discount from a subscription. This
can be done by providing the coupon with which the discount was created:

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.processout.com/subscriptions/sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3/discounts/25percentoff \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %>
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
client.newDiscount({
    id:              "25percentoff",
    subscription_id: "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3"
}).delete().then(function(subscription) {
    //

}, function(err) {
    // The subscription could not be found

});
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
client.new_discount().delete({
    id:              "25percentoff",
    subscription_id: "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3"
})
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
client.discount.delete(
    id:              "25percentoff",
    subscription_id: "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3"
)
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
$subscription = $client->newSubscription()->find("sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3");
$subscription->removeDiscount("25percentoff");
$client->newDiscount()->delete(array(
    "id"              => "25percentoff",
    "subscription_id" => "sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3"
))
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
err := client.NewDiscount().Delete(&processout.DiscountDeleteParameters{
    Discount: &processout.Discount{
        ID:             processout.String("25percentoff"),
        SubscriptionID: processout.String("sub_7kAxfNML6jIc3bltGIt0uK2nKHDyzzq3"),
    },
})
```
</div>
