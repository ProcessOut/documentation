# Testing your ProcessOut integration

Testing your ProcessOut integration is crucial to make sure everything works
as intended before pushing your code into production. ProcessOut provides you
with a few tools you can use to quickly check everything.

<hr>

## Testing environment

A testing environment is available for developers who want to test their
integration of ProcessOut. We strongly advise you to use our testing environment
when implementing any of our products.

Most of the ProcessOut objects can be created in the production or test environments.
Objects created in one environment will not be available in the other. Objects
created in the testing environment will have the attribute `sandbox` set to
`true`.

To enable the testing environment, simply prepend your project ID with `test-`
when instanciating the ProcessOut clients, like so:

<div class="language-selector-wrapper">
<%= partial "lg-selector" %>
```shell
curl https://api.processout.com/ \
    <%= partial "header-curl" %>
```

```javascript
<%= partial "header-js" %>
```

```python
<%= partial "header-python" %>
```

```ruby
<%= partial "header-ruby" %>
```

```php
<%= partial "header-php" %>
```

```go
<%= partial "header-go" %>
```
</div>

**Warning:** Remember to remove the `test` prefix when switching to production.

## Test cards

When using the test environment, test cards can be used to simulate real-world cards.
We provide you with a handy set of test cards in different brands, as well as
special cards which will have a special effect when used during checkout. This
is meant to help you test special test cases easily.

Please note that any real-world card will not work in the test environment. Also,
the expiry date and CVC code of the cards will not be checked.
